  <h2 class="about-section-header">About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Roman Navarro. I was born just outside of Stockton, California, the city where I was raised and continue to live. I decided that I wanted to be a game developer when I was 12 years old. Back then, I would write down all my game ideas in various notebooks. I would go into detail about mechanics, story elements, and gameplay. I would write about things that back then no games implemented that I felt would be cool, like extensive, gruesome takedown animations for first person shooters, depending on which weapon you had equipped, like the executions from Manhunt, or exagerated sounds of war, like yelling, screaming in pain, orders being shouted angrily, and ear-piercing explosions to make it seem more realistic and scary. In school, sometimes I'd get so bored in class that I'd write stories in this tiny notebook I had then. This writing was mainly just short snippets and was largely disorganized. After a while, I'd get bored of whatever I was writing about and move on to writing something else, so there were countless unfinished ideas and stories. </p>

  <p>In March 2020, school all of a sudden got cancelled due to covid. With no real job or a healthy hobby like a sport or church, I all of a sudden had a surplus of spare time. Instead of finding a hobby like a sport or applying for a job, I stayed home. Seventeen year old me then all of a sudden had what I like to call an artistic renesaince. All the experience I acquired from writing those snippets for all those years finally bore fruit, like how defeats make an army wise and experienced from learning from their mistakes and in the end up they end conquering everything and everyone, despite what military analysts might have said. During this time, I discovered I had a sort of talent for drawing. I like drawing, and I would draw quite a bit (mainly sceneries like my backyard) but I feel I can better express myself through writing, plus I think it's funner. During the Summer and Fall of 2020 I wrote the scripts for games I want to make called "Genocide: Destroyer of Worlds" and "Genocide II: God of Death". The characters for Genocide I had actually originally designed back in 2nd grade, if you can believe it. Their design has not changed much since. To this day, just as the late legend Virgil Abloh said, â€œEverything I do is for the 17-year-old version of myself." </p>
